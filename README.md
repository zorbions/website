## Overview

A minimalist portfolio website designed to showcase creative work, technical projects, and professional experience. Built with clean code principles and modern web standards.

## Core Features

Performance-first architecture with lazy loading and optimized assets. Smooth scroll navigation with section anchors. Dynamic project filtering system. Integrated contact capabilities. Dark mode support with system preference detection.

## Technology Stack

Built with React 18 for component architecture and state management. Styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes for rapid, consistent design. Icons powered by Lucide React for crisp, scalable visuals. Bundled with Create React App for streamlined development workflow.

## Local Development

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zorbions/website.git
cd website
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. Changes will hot-reload automatically.

## Design Philosophy

The design emphasizes clarity over decoration. White space creates breathing room for content. Typography hierarchy guides the reader naturally. Color is used sparingly for emphasis and brand identity. Interactions feel responsive and intentional.

## Content Sections

**Landing** introduces the visitor with a focused statement of purpose and immediate navigation paths.

**Work** presents selected projects with contextual information, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

**Experience** outlines professional background, skills, and ongoing learning initiatives.

**Connect** provides multiple contact methods and social presence links.

## Customization Guide

Replace placeholder content in component files with your information. Update Tailwind theme configuration in `tailwind.config.js` for brand consistency. Swap images in the public/assets directory maintaining aspect ratios. Modify navigation structure in `App.jsx` and corresponding components. Customize Lucide icons by importing different options from the library.

## Performance Targets

First Contentful Paint under 1.5 seconds. Time to Interactive under 3 seconds. Lighthouse score above 95 across all metrics. Total page weight under 500KB initial load.

## Browser Support

Tested and verified on current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Graceful degradation for older browsers. Mobile-first responsive design breakpoints.

## Deployment

Build the production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized site will be generated in the `dist` directory. Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages with zero configuration. Configure custom domain through your hosting platform. Enable HTTPS for secure connections.
